# natural-events-occurring-on-Earth

This repository focuses on analysing data from the Earth Observing Natural Event Tracker (EONET), which collects and updates metadata on natural events occurring globally. The dataset includes information on natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, and other environmental events, with corresponding geometries, event types.

### I used API from NASA website, the three main questions for analysing are:

1. Do time periods and regions affect the occurrence of disasters?
2. Is global climate change causing more disasters?
3. Is it possible to predict future disasters?
